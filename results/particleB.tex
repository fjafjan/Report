\caption{The first two stretches match very well as well as the last two. In the reversal between these two there is a large change which begins at (1) where the flow is starting to revert. This reversal also occurs at the end of the channel closer to the pump. Starts at $ x_0 = 9.3 mm, z_0 = 35\mu m, D \approx 100\mu m$}

\caption{Mostly constant orbit for large $n_z$. The reversals at (1) and (3) both change the orbit slightly but the size of the change is exaggerated by $n_z$ being very close to 1. The actual change in orbit can be seen in figure \ref{fig:October1Particle4runs2and2Orbits} is not as large as this plot might indicate. There is missing data at (2) and (4) where the particle was lost in tracking for some time. Started at $x_0 = 28.6 mm, z_0 = 72\mu m, D = \approx 85\mu$ m. }
