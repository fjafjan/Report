During the work of this thesis around 300 movies of particles have been recorded with gradual improvements to the setup in terms of density matching, particle density, bubble elimination etc. In this section we will present the data from three movies of two different particles. One referred to as particle A, the other as particle B. The measurements in this section was done together with Alexander Laas.

Each measurement was started at an approximate depth $D$ and at position $p_0 = (x_0, z_0)$ in the channel relative to the inlet on the right, closer to the pump. Since we want the shear to be entire in the $y$ direction we would want to be as close to $z_0 = 0$ as possible, but variations less than \unit[1]{mm} should still have virtually identical shear.

In the time series plots below such as figure \ref{fig:particleA1}, the circular and star markers indicate the peaks used for estimating the winding number as explained in section \ref{sec:windingEstimation}. A circle is an estimated minima $m_i$, stars an estimated maxima $M_i$.
