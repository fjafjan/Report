\caption{The face map for $\lambda = 8$ and $\epsilon = 0.02$. The measured $\lambda$ was $8.2 \pm 0.1$. The orbits of the best fit theoretical fits to measurements are highlighted stretch by stretch. Most measurements for this particle were rather constant, but the winding numbers are within 50\% of the estimates but both are too low, suggesting that the $\epsilon$ might be too low.}

\end{center}
\caption{Despite being very close to a centre orbit there is very little quasi periodic behaviour. The very flattened peaks compared to a low $n_z$ orbit in \ref{fig:orbitparams} are a result of the width compensation discussed in section \ref{sec:width_compensation}. This particle started $x_0 = 9.8 mm, z_0 = 8.9924 \mu m$ and $D \approx 90\mu$m.}

\caption{Estimating the sinking of the particle and the z position in the channel. The period here refers to the distance between two successive zeros for $n_x$ relative to the first. There is no clear trend to higher or lower values which suggests that there is little sinking/floating. The drift in the z coordinate is also very small relative to the movements in the x direction, these are on the order of $10\mu m$ compared to the x direction which is on the order of $2\cdot 10^4 \mu m$}

\end{center}
\caption{Shows $n_x$ and $n_x$ first and second stretches from figure \ref{fig:particleA1} but against the actual position in the channel as opposed to commulative distance. There is an almost perfect match along the entire channel for $n_x$ and only small disagreement for $n_z$. The dashed lines indicate the error margins for detecting $n_z=0$.}

\end{center}
\caption{The speed (note not the velocity) of the particle against distance as well as time. The most distinct difference is in the time plot where we see in the first reversal there is a "double dip". This only and always occurs at the reversal at the far end from the pump. There is also noticeably different acceleration behaviour that is consistently different across all measurements.}

\caption{A tracked particle with a large $n_z$ component with a very consistent periodic behaviour. 
$ x_0 = 26.0 mm, z_0 = 275\mu m, D\approx 105\mu$ m.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/results/particleA/October_11_Particle_2_run_6_A.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The peaks that occur after each reversal are not the cause of a tracking error but can be seen clearly in the films. The cause of such a sudden peak and then reverting back to another orbit is not known and we have no good theoretical explanation for it. We begin to break around (3) which is also where there is a change in the orbit. The particle starts at $ x_0 = 12.3 mm, z_0 = 160 \mu m, D \approx 100\mu$m.}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/results/particleA/October_11_Particle_2_run_1_A.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The flow is reversed when the particle is at (1) and and we can see that the peaks are larger than what we would expect from the rest of the stretch. Started at $x_0 = 8.7 mm, z_0 = 16\mu m, D \approx 95\mu$m.}

1: Very bad reversal. Note that this very bad reversal occurs at the "pump side" of the channel. 
 2: A slight change in orbit, but it is still in the same region on the SOS.
 3: Data that haven't been cleaned.}

The reversal occurs at the left and although there is some moderate agreement in $n_x$ the match in $n_z$ is non existant from the very start.}
