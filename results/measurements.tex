\subsection{Measurements of particle A}
Particle A was measured on October 11 in 2013. Two of the measurements retraced their orbits very well: measurement 1 and measurement 2 which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:particleA1} and Figure \ref{fig:particleA2} respectively. Measurement 1 was started with initial condition $n_z \approx 0$ and showed quasi periodic behaviour with a periodic change in amplitude for $n_z$ peaks. Measurement 2 was started with initial condition $n_z \approx 1$ and showed periodic behaviour with very constant $n_z$ peaks. 

Other measurement had reversals where the orbit changed considerably, two examples are seen in Figure \ref{fig:particleA3} and \ref{fig:particleA4}. All measurement data for particle A can be found at \url{goo.gl/jgzSXe} where particle A is referred to as particle 2 from October 11. 


\subsubsection{Measurement 1}

\end{center}
\caption{The $n_x$ and $n_z$ components of the particle for measurement 1 against cumulative distance in channel. Despite being very close to a centre orbit there is limited quasi-periodic behaviour as the peaks stay close to 0. The very flattened peaks compared to a low $n_z$ orbit in \ref{fig:orbitparams} are a result of the width compensation discussed in section \ref{sec:width_compensation}. This particle started $x_0 = 9.8 mm, z_0 = 8.9924 \mu m$ and $D \approx 90\mu$m. This is the same measurement as is used in Figure 6.20 in Laas thesis~\cite{alexanderThesis}}

\subsubsection{Measurement 2}

\end{center}
\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 2 against cumulative distance. The $n_z$ component is consistently close to 1 at the peaks. 
The particle started at $ x_0 = 26.0 \text{mm}, z_0 = 275\mu\text{m}, D\approx 105\mu$m. This figure is the same as Laas~\cite{alexanderThesis} Figure 6.21}

\subsubsection{Measurement 3}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/results/particleA/October_11_Particle_2_run_6_A.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 3 against cumulative distance. The larger peaks that occur after the reversals are not the cause of a tracking error but can be seen clearly in the films. The reversal of the flow is started when the particle is next to the point marked (3) which is also where there is a change in $n_z$ component. The particle started at $ x_0 = 12.3 \text{mm}, z_0 = 160 \mu\text{m}, D \approx 100\mu$m.}

\subsubsection{Measurement 4}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/results/particleA/October_11_Particle_2_run_1_A.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 4 against cumulative distance. The flow is reversed when the particle is at the point marked by (1) and we can see that the peaks around the reversal are larger than for the rest of the measurement. Started at $x_0 = 8.7 mm, z_0 = 16\mu m, D \approx 95\mu$m.}

\subsubsection{Measurement 5}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/results/particleA/October_11_Particle_2_run_4_A.pdf}
\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 5 against cumulative distance. At the point marked by (1) $n_z$ changes drastically at the reversal which occurs at the side of the channel closer to the pump. Although there is also some change in the orbit at the reversal marked by (2) it does not move comparably far on the S.O.S. There are a number of small peaks in the data such as the one indicated by (3) which is a consequence of insufficient removal of tracking errors, see Section \ref{sec:brushing}. The particle started at $x_0 = 10.7 mm, z_0 = 240 \mu m, D \approx 60\mu m$.}

\subsection{Measurements of particle B}
Particle B was measured on October 1 2013. Particle B has four measurements for which most reversals showed little change in orbit. These are shown below in Figures \ref{fig:particleB1}, \ref{fig:particleB2}, \ref{fig:particleB3} and \ref{fig:particleB4}. There were also problematic measurements of particle B analogous to those for particle A, but they have not been included in this section for brevity. All measurement data for particle B can be found at \url{goo.gl/jgzSXe} where particle B is referred to as particle 4 from October 1. 

\subsubsection{Measurement 1}

\end{center}
\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 1 against cumulative distance. The first two and the last two stretches the particle retraces its motion very closely during the reversals. In the reversal between these two reversals there is a large change in orbit which begins at (1) where the flow is starting to revert. This reversal occurs at the end of the channel closer to the pump. Starts at $ x_0 = 9.3$mm $,z_0 = 35\mu m, D \approx 100\mu m$. This is the same measurement as is used in Figures 6.2 and 6.4 in Laas thesis~\cite{alexanderThesis}}

\subsubsection{Measurement 2}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/results/particleB/October_1_Particle_4_run_4_A.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 2 against cumulative distance. The orbit is mostly constant orbit with $n_z \approx 1$ at the peaks. The reversals at (1) and (3) both change the orbit slightly however the difference between the peaks is small and the best matched theoretical orbits in Figure\ref{fig:October1Particle4runs2and2Orbits} are similar before and after reversals. There is missing data at (2) and (4) where the particle was no able to be tracked. The particle started at $x_0 = 28.6$mm, $z_0 = 72\mu$m, $D = \approx 85\mu$m. This is the same measurement as is used in Figure 6.8 in Laas thesis~\cite{alexanderThesis}}

\caption{The $n_z$ and $n_x$ components for measurement 3 against cumulative distance. The initial condition is $n_z \approx 0$ and the sign changes periodically. Started at $x_0 = 2.7 mm, z_0 = 76\mu m, D \approx 90\mu$m. This is the same measurement as is used in Figures 6.10 and 6.12 in Laas thesis~\cite{alexanderThesis}}
