\section{Introduction}
The goal of this thesis is to study and better understand the dynamics of ellipsoidal particles in shear flow, and is a continuation of two previous masters theses \cite{AntonThesis, JonasThesis}. This is done by analysing micrometer length glass particles in a shear flow and comparing this to theoretical models. Before discussing either of these processes more in depth some background and basic theory is needed.

\subsection{Background}
The study of particle dynamics in flow began with Einstein's paper from 1905 \cite{Einstein} in which he showed that the viscocity of suspended particles would increase the viscosity of the fluid and by how much. Jeffrey in his 1922 paper \cite{Jeffrey} extended these results to ellipsoidal axis-symmetrical particles as well as derived equations for the orientational dynamics of the particles. For systems where inertial effects could be discarded the motion was found to be periodic and depending only on the initial condition of the particle.

Developments on triaxial particles, started with Gierszewski \& Chaffey (1978)\cite{Chaffey} and was continued by Hinch \& Leal (1979)\cite{Leal} and more recently by Yarin et al in 1993\cite{Yarin}. 
The dynamics found for axis-symmetric particles by Jeffrey were periodic, but it was shown by Hinch \& Leal that some orbits would be doubly periodic, in other words following two separate independent periods. 
Yarin then was able to use numerical simulations to generate a surface of section \cite{SurfaceOfSection} for some asymmetric relations between the two minor axes showing that not only was there double periodic or quasi periodic orbits but for sufficiently large asymmetries in axes there would be chaotic orbits. 
Several other surfaces of were also produced by Johansson (2012)\cite{AntonThesis} using the same method as Yarin with higher resolution thanks to improvements in computing power. It was there shown that only very small asymmetries on the order of 1\% will lead to quasi-periodic motion for some initial conditions.

Experimental studies of these theoretical results were first done by Goldsmith and Mason in 1962\cite{Mason} who confirmed that the rotation rate matched well with that predicted from Jeffrey orbits but he did not study the actual orbits. Since then most experimental research, such as by Harlen and Koch\cite{fibersspension} has been focused on diluted suspensions of particles and the increased viscocity and other properties this causes. Only tangential efforts such as by Tolga\cite{Tolga} were concerned with the Jeffrey orbits. A good summary of both theoretical and experimental results was written by Petrie in 1999 \cite{Petrie}.

The first dedicated experimental work to try to measure the actual Jeffrey orbits and study the orientational dynamics was done by Einarsson et al \cite{JonasExperiment} in 2011. Although there was some promising results, the vast majority of particles were asymmetric to the point of chaotic or highly quasi-periodic. Moreover the width and length of particles both varied great and could not be measured with good accuracy, meaning that the aspect ratio could not accurately be determined.
