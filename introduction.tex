\section{Introduction}
My goal in this thesis is to study and better understand the dynamics of ellipsoidal particles in shear flow, and is a continuation of two previous masters theses \cite{AntonThesis, JonasThesis}. This is done by analysing micrometer length glass particles in a shear flow and comparing this to theoretical models. Before discussing either of these processes more in depth some background and basic theory is needed.

\subsection{Background}
Understanding the dynamics of particles in flow might appear somewhat esoteric but there is actually a number of topics 
where it is important. In fluid dynamics non-newtonian fluids are often high concentrations of particles suspended in 
liquid, such ketchup or blood, and understanding this behaviour might need an improved understanding of how each 
individual particle will behave. In medical applications understanding the dynamics of ellipsoidal particles like 
bacteria can be relevant to a detailed understanding of their interactions with cells and other bodies as discussed by 
Tolga et al\cite{Tolga}. So if we accept that it is a topic worth studying the next question is how much do we already 
know.

The study of particle dynamics in flow began with Einstein's paper from 1905 \cite{Einstein} in which he showed how much the suspended spherical particle would increase the viscocity of a fluid. Jeffrey in his 1922 paper \cite{Jeffrey} extended these results to ellipsoidal axis-symmetrical ellipsoidal  particles and derived equations for the orientational dynamics of the particles, in other words how the particles would rotate as a function of time. For systems where inertial effects could be discarded the motion was found to be periodic and depending only on the initial condition of the particle. 

Developments on triaxial particles, started with Gierszewski \& Chaffey (1978)\cite{Chaffey} and was continued by Hinch \& Leal (1979)\cite{Leal} and more recently by Yarin et al in 1993\cite{Yarin}. 
The dynamics found for axis-symmetric particles by Jeffrey were periodic, but it was shown by Hinch \& Leal that some orbits would be doubly periodic, in other words following two separate independent periods. This behaviour will primarily be referred to as quasi-periodic from here-on out.

Yarin then was able to use numerical simulations to generate a surface of section \cite{SurfaceOfSection} for some asymmetric relations between the two minor axes showing that not only was there double periodic or quasi periodic orbits but for sufficiently large asymmetries there would be chaotic orbits. 
Several other surfaces of section were also produced by Johansson (2012)\cite{AntonThesis} using the same method as Yarin with higher resolution thanks to improvements in computing power. It was shown that only very small asymmetries on the order of 1\% will lead to quasi-periodic motion for some initial conditions.

Attempts to experimentally verify these theoretical results were first done by Goldsmith and Mason in 1962\cite{Mason} who used flow in a glass pipe to observe the rotation rate for several different particle shapes. He was able to confirm that the rotation rate matched well with that predicted from Jeffery orbits but he did not study the actual orbits. Since then most experimental research, such as by Harlen and Koch\cite{fibersspension} has been focused on the effect diluted suspensions of particles have on the properties of a liquid. Only tangential efforts such as by Tolga\cite{Tolga} were concerned with the Jeffery orbits. A good summary of both theoretical and experimental results was written by Petrie in 1999 \cite{Petrie}.

The first dedicated experiments to measure the actual Jeffery orbits in angular components and verify the orientational dynamics was done by Einarsson et al \cite{JonasExperiment} in 2011. Although there was some promising results, the vast majority of particles were asymmetric to the point of chaotic or highly quasi-periodic. Moreover the width and length of particles both varied great and could not be measured with good accuracy, meaning that the aspect ratio could not accurately be determined. This mean that although the orbits could be qualitatively shown to be similar to some Jeffery orbits no particular particle could be shown to exhibit both quasi periodic and periodic motion, and there was no particle that could be well matched to a particular orbit. There was also quite few particles that showed a perfectly identical reversal through the entire length of the channel when the flow was reversed.


% I really want a cite for thus but how could I possibly do that.
The goal now is to experimentally verify the results of \cite{Yarin, Leal} and show that the same particle will show different types of motion for different initial conditions and furthermore that different particles will also show different motion for the same initial conditions based on the asymmetry. To do this we will study orientation of a micrometer length particle in a creeping shear flow. To verify that the flow is a creeping flow we will show that the dynamics revert as the flow is reverted. The results for different initial conditions will then be compared to theoretical predictions.

%doing so would be very important to actually motivating using these results as well as possibly finding the limitations of this theory in real world applications. Understanding the dynamics of ellipsoidal particles in shear flow could be useful for example in our understanding of microscopic bacteria in blood stream
