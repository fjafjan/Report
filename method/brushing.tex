The tracking will typically have a few frames where either the particle is obstructed or is not detected correctly 
leading to spikes in the data. To make further theoretical analysis possible such points are removed manually. The basis 
for removal is simply a large discontinuity in the data, and could largely be eliminated with algorithmic means. However 
in particular for $n_z$ it's very difficult to write an algorithm that will satisfactory catch all possible edge cases. 
$n_z$ have peaks that make its derivative non continuous. It's thus simpler to look at the analysis program and remove 
the points where the particle cannot be traced accurately due to noise.
