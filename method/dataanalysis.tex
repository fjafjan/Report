\label{sec:dataanalysis}
Once a measurement has been made and a movie recorded the orientational dynamics are estimated. The first step is to identify the particle and approximate its position and orientation at every point. This is done using software from Johansson \cite{AntonThesis} and is explained in detail in his thesis and summarized below.

\section{Particle identification}\label{sec:particleidentification}

The first step of the data analysis is to reduce the static noise from the movie caused by dirt, scratches and other defects in the microscope and on the camera lens as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:origFrame}. As the noise is static and the actual contents of the image changes the noise is isolated by computing an average frame of all frames in a movie using equation \ref{eq:averageFrame}

An example of such an average frame can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:averageFrame}. The average frame is removed from the camera frame and the result can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:fixedFrame}. After this we apply a gaussian smoothing function and Canny edge detection \cite{Canny} and fill the resulting edge located closest to the previous particle location. The resulting pixels are then fit to an ellipse as described in \cite{AntonThesis, EllipseFit}, the ellipse is defined by a length $l_e$, width $D$ and an angle $\phi_p$ from the $x$-axis. Note that $\phi_p$ is The filled contour and the fit ellipse can be seen in Figure 
\ref{fig:edgeFrame}.

\section{Estimation of orientation}

The ellipsoid given by the fitting is then our best approximation of the projection in the $x$-$z$ plane. The projection of the particle along the $x$-axis and $z$-axis are found by
\begin{align} \label{eq:project}
p_x  &= l_e \sin(\phi_p) \\
p_z  &= l_e \cos(\phi_p) 
\end{align}

Here $p_x$ and $p_z$ are the $x$-axis and $z$-axis projection respectively.

To find the unit vector $\mathbf{n}$ we need to know the length of the particle. It was shown by Leal \cite{Leal} that the particle always spends a majority of its time aligned with the flow, ie aligned with the camera plane. This means that by finding the ellipse length $l_e$ every frame and finding the mode of the distribution we find a good estimate of $L$. We find the orientation vector $\mathbf{n}$ from Section \ref{sec:jeffery} by normalizing the projections

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:normalize}
\begin{align}
n_x 	&= \frac{p_x}{L}, \\
n_z 	&= \frac{p_z}{L}, \\
n_y		&= \sqrt{1 - n_x^2 - n_z^2}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

This allows us to make comparisons between theory and measurement. Until this point the data analysis is the same as that in Johansson \cite{AntonThesis}.

\section{Width compensation}\label{sec:width_compensation}
We have assumed that the particle is a \emph{thin} rod so that the projection $\mathbf{p}$ onto the $x$ and $z$-axes give us an accurate estimate of $\mathbf{n}$. However, when we consider that our particle is 'thick' with length $l_e$ as well as width $D$, the actual unit vector we find using eq. (\ref{eq:normalize}) in the above algorithm is $\mathbf{n}'$. Because of the width of the particle, it appears as an ellipse even when $n_z = n_x = 0$ as shown in the lower right part of Figure \ref{fig:lengtherror}. Looking at the points where $\phi = 0$, which are the points plotted on the surfaces of section and thus of the most interest, we find

\begin{equation}\label{eq:widthcomp}
\left| \left|\mathbf{n}'\right|\right| = \frac{p_z'}{L} = \frac{p_z\cos(\theta)  + D\sin(\theta)}{L}. 
\end{equation}

\noindent Here $L$ is the particle length and $D$ is the particle width. The difference between the measured orientation vector $\mathbf{n}$' and the actual orientation vector $\mathbf{n}$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:lengtherror} for 4 different values of $\theta$. 

In order to compensate for the width of the particle we modify our projection equation \ref{eq:project} to

\begin{align}\label{eq:widthCompensation}
p_x  &= (l_e - D) \sin(\phi_p) \\
p_z  &= (l_e - D) \cos(\phi_p) 
\end{align}

\noindent Using eq. (\ref{eq:widthCompensation}) reduces the particles estimated length by $D$ but this is solved by normalizing with $L-D$ instead of L in \ref{eq:normalize}.

This change completely removes the error for $n_z = 0$ which is when the error is largest. It does however cause slight distortions in the orbit and a better method could be deviced.
