\label{sec:exp_setup}
The orientational motion of $\mu$m-sized particles suspended in a liquid was investigated by pumping the liquid through a microfluidic channel using a syringe pump. The channel is placed on a moveable stage on top of a microscope. A particle is tracked by moving the stage to match the center of mass velocity of the particle in the channel and thus keep the particle stationary in the field of view of the microscope. Connected to the microscope is a CCD camera recording the images and these movies are saved on a computer. 

When the tracked particle gets within \unit[10]{mm} of the inlets on the channel the flow is reversed. If the particle retraces its motion when the flow is reversed we know that no noise has disturbed the motion and that the flow is Stokes flow, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:fluid}. In order to reduce the sudden impact of the pressure difference caused by the flow reversal, the reversals are performed in several steps. At the start of a reversal the infusion/withdrawal rate is reduced by 50\% for 10 seconds, then stopped completely for 10 seconds. After this the pump resumes in the reverse direction at 50\% of the normal flow rate for another 10 seconds before resuming at full speed. 

The movies are analyzed as described in Section \ref{sec:dataanalysis}. We refer to the trajectory of $\mathbf{n}$ for a particle along one length of the channel a \textbf{stretch} and a series of stretches for a single particle a \textbf{measurement}. A sketch of the experimental setup can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:setupsketch}, and a photograph of the actual setup in Figure \ref{fig:setuppicture}. 

Between measurements, optical tweezers constructed by A. Laas were used to change the orientation of the particle. For details on optical tweezers see the introductory guide from Stanford, \cite{OpticalTweezer} or Laas thesis \cite{alexanderThesis}.

The microfluidic channel is \unit[40]{mm} long, \unit[2.5]{mm} wide and approximately \unit[150]{$\mu$m} deep. The channel is made from Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and plasma bonded to a microscope slide. A more detailed description of the process can be found from the Center for Computer Integrated Systems for Microscopy and Manipulation~\cite{PDMS}. This material and procedure is chosen so that a channel that gets filled with dirt or breaks can cheaply and easily be replaced. Dirt in this case refers primarily to bubbles and to particles that stick to the glass or the PDMS. PDMS is non-reactive which means surface effects and other interactions with the particles are not a concern. PDMS is also highly transparent which means the light from the microscope illuminator won't be blocked or distorted before hitting the particles. A sketch of the channel can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:channelsketch}, and a photograph of an actual channel in Figure \ref{fig:channelpicture}.

In order to find the maximum flow speed of the channel we need to know the flow profile. Using the software employed by Johansson \cite{AntonThesis} which in turn is using the result from Zheng~\cite{flowprofile}, we solve the Poisson equation in a rectangular channel to obtain the flow profile. The solution for our channel measurements can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:flowprofile}. 
Integrating the flow profile over the entire surface gives an effective flow area, essentially how large the channel 'actually' is. 
Using the flow profile from Figure \ref{fig:flowprofile} we find that the effective flow area is $\unit[0.14]{mm^2}$. With a pump rate of \unit[7.5]{$\mu$l/minute} we get a maximum velocity of \unit[0.90]{mm/s} for the liquid.

\noindent We need to confirm that the flow is Stokes' flow and thus have no inertial effects. We can calculate the maximum Reynolds number using eq \ref{eq:reynolds}, the \unit[3]{$\mu$m} length rods, and our maximum flow speed.

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Re} = \frac{U W \rho}{\mu} 
\leq \frac{9.0\cdot 10^{-4} \cdot 3 \cdot 10^{-3} 2.5 }{24 \cdot 10^{-3}} 
\approx	 2.78  \cdot 10^{-6} \ll 1.
\end{equation}

\noindent This should satisfy the conditions of validity for the Jeffery equations. 

To track the particles the channel is put in a moveable stage on a confocal microscope. The entire setup can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:setuppicture}
