As the goal is to attempt to verify the Jeffrey equations in eq \ref{eq:jeffrey} we need an experimental setup with 
particles and flow system that satisfy the conditions during which the Jeffrey equations apply. This means our particles 
have to be buoyant, triaxially symmetric and the flow has to be Stokes flow. 



Thus two sets of glass particles from Nippon Glass, Japan\cite{Particles}, have been used. 
They are cylindrical with a consistent width of \unit[3]{$\mu$m} and \unit[5]{$\mu$m} and varying length. Images taken 
with a STEM microscope can be seen in figure \ref{fig:particlepictures}. 


%While these particles seemingly satisfy the symmetry conditions they are made glass with a density of approximately 
%\unit[2.57]{g/cm$^3$} at \unit[20]{C$^\circ$} which is significantly higher than that of water with a density of 
%\unit[1]{g/cm$^3$} at \unit[20]{C$^\circ$} and glycerol with a density of \unit[1.5]{g/cm$^3$}. Thus to correct for the 
%density and limit sinking or floating the water soluble Sodium metatungstate which at \unit[20]{C$^\circ$} has maximum 
%density of \unit[2.94]{g/cm$^3$}. To increase the viscosity of the liquid around 8\% glycerol is added, resulting in a 
%measured dynamic viscosity of \unit[$24\cdot 10^{-3}$]{Pa s}

This liquid with suspended particles is flowed through a channel of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) \unit[4]{cm} long,
 \unit[2.5]{mm} wide and either \unit[200]{$\mu$m} and \unit[500]{$\mu$m}. The flow profile of such a channel was 
 calculated by Anton Johansson in his thesis\cite{AntonThesis} and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:flowprofile}. The 
 flow rate varies  between $2$ and \unitfrac[20]{$\mu$l}{m} or in SI units \unitfrac[$3.33\cdot 10^-10$]{m$^3$}{s} 
 which with a cross section of at least \unit[$5\cdot 10^-7$]{m$^2$}means a maximum flow speed of  
 \unitfrac[6.66]{mm}{s}.

To confirm that the flow is a creeping flow we can calculate the maximum Reynolds number using eq \ref{eq:reynolds} and 
our maximum flow speed 

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Re} = \frac{U L \rho}{\mu} 
\leq \frac{6.66\cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 2.5 \cdot 10^{-3} 2.5 }{24 \cdot 10^{-3}} 
\approx	 	1.6  \cdot 10^{-3} \ll 1
\end{equation}

This should satisfy the conditions of the Jeffrey equations. To track the particles the channel is put in a moveable stage on a confocal microscope. The entire setup can be seen in figure \ref{fig:experimentalsetup}

\subsection{List of equipment}
The equipment used during the experiment is as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Leica DFC350 FX digital camera 
\item Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope
\item Nikon 60x water immersion objective
\item Märzhäuser Wetzlar 'LStep-eco' step engine
\item CMA 4004 syringe pump
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Density matching}
\begin{equation}
\rho_{a} = 	\frac {m_{a}}{V_{a}} =
				\frac{V_{b}\rho_{b} + V_{mix}\rho_{mix}}{V_b + V_{mix}} 
\end{equation}
So if we want to find $V_{mix}$ we get
\begin{equation}
V_{mix} = \frac{ V_{b}(\rho_{b} - \rho_{a})}{\rho_{a} - \rho_{mix}} 
\end{equation}
