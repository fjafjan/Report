\noindent In order to get accurate measuremens of the Jeffery orbits we need a carefully designed experimental setup. The experimental setup used in this thesis is an iteration of the one used by Einarsson \emph{et al.}~\cite{JonasExperiment}, Johansson \cite{AntonThesis}, and Mishra \emph{et al.}~\cite{Mishra}. In this chapter we describe the setup and why it is designed the way it is. In particular we describe a tracking algorithm that was implemented to make gathering data easier. We also discuss the improvements over previous iterations, as well as new problems that have arisen from the changes we made to the experimental setup.
