Orientational motion of axisymmetrical particles in shear flow is important in a number of scientific fields. It was first studied by Jeffery, who showed that an axissymmetical particle in shear flow will follow one of infinitely many periodic orbits depending on the initial condition of the particle. Later studies by Yarin suggested that asymmetric particles may follow periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic orbits depending only on the initial conditions. This thesis attempts to experimentally verify Yarin's predictions for the equations of motion, using glass particles in a reversible flow in a microfluidic PDMS channel. An optical tweezer is used to control the initial conditions . An automatic tracking of the particles was developed, and a number of improvements were made compared to previous experiments by Einarsson et al\cite{JonasExperiment}. We study the effects of asymmetry on the particles, and the transition from periodic to quasi-periodic orbits for different initial conditions of particles, and for different degrees of asymmetry. Some measurements show good agreement with theoretical prediction, but there recurring unexplained behaviours when the flow is reversed. Measurements were made in collaboration with Alexander Laas \cite{alexanderThesis}.
