\begin{abstract}
The Jeffrey orbits define the motion of axissymmetrical particles in shear flow and is thus important in the study of suspensions of particles. In these theses we verify the equations of motion experimentally using glass particles in a reversible flow in a PDMS microchannel and an optical tweezer. We also study the effects of asymmetry on the particles and study the transition from periodic to quasi-periodic orbits for different initial conditions and degrees of asymmetry. A good match with theoretical results are found, but there are some unexplained behaviours when the  flow is reversed.

I hereby wish to thank my girlfriend Callie Gibbons for supporting me through the work on this thesis and Alexander Laas for being a tireless and understanding co-worker. I want to thank my supervisors Bernhard Mehlig and Dag Hanstorp for helping with good suggestions. I want to thank all the contributors to the wealth of open source software which I have used to create everything from most of the software to more of the figures and of course this very report.
