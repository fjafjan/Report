The Jeffery orbits define the motion of axissymmetrical particles in shear flow and is thus important in the study of suspensions of particles. In this thesis I attempt to verify the equations of motion experimentally using glass particles in a reversible flow in a microfluidic PDMS channel and an optical tweezer. An automatic tracking of the particles was developed and a number of improvements were made compared to previous experiments such as by Einarsson et al\cite{JonasExperiment}. We study the effects of asymmetry on the particles and the transition from periodic to quasi-periodic orbits for different initial conditions of particles and for different degrees of asymmetry. One good match with theoretical results is found for some measurements, but there are some unexplained behaviours when the  flow is reversed.
