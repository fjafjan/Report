\begin{abstract}
The Jeffrey orbits define the motion of axissymmetrical particles in shear flow and is thus important in the study of suspensions of particles. In these theses we verify the equations of motion experimentally using glass particles in a reversible flow in a PDMS microchannel and an optical tweezer. We also study the effects of asymmetry on the particles and study the transition from periodic to quasiperiodic orbits for different initiatial conditions and degrees of asymetry. A good match with theoretical results are found, but there are some unexplained behaviours when the  flow is reversed.
