\section{Jeffrey Orbits}
\input{theory/JeffreyOrbits.tex}
% Not quite sure how far in depth I should go here
\section{Kalman filter}
% Should I even have this section?

\chapter{Method}

\section{Experimental Setup}
\input{method/experimentalsetup.tex}


% This should not be a chapter but a section of the experimental setup. Maybe a section of 
% that should be improvements and I can include the Automated tracking can be part of that
% I should also ask Dag if it's reasonable to include a section of attempted improvements, as
% a guideline to anyone who tris to replicate the experiment both about what can be done (for inspiration)
% but then as a caution that while you may try this it did not work for us

TODO:
READ UP ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE CANNY EDGE DETECTION
TAKE AN IMAGE OF THE STATIC NOISE REDUCTION (DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK?!)
GET AN IMAGE OF BEFORE AND AFTER SMOOTHING, PREFERABLY INCLUDE A CANNY EDGE DETECTION OF BOTH 
WRITE ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO DO VARIOUS STUFFS (IS THIS NEEDED?)
GET MORE SOURCES IN THE THEORY SECTION
IN PARTICULAR:
Looking up reynolds number sources, "creeping motion" might be a relevant term
Add our measured visc and add it to citations, maybe add Dag how to cite that?


JEFFREY ORBIT STUFF:
Make a picture illustrating the various angles
Have a picture of some jeffrey orbits

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP STUFF:
Include the distribution of lengths, either meassured or from nippon
