To conclude we return to the problems listed in in section \ref{list:problems} 

\begin{enumerate} \label{list:solutions}
	\item The particles are now all symmetric to be used for measurements
	\item The particles have low aspect ratios and uniform widths allowing which makes accurate estimations of size possible
	\item The lower aspect ratios means there are more flips that can be used to estimate the orbit.
	\item Particles are made from glass meaning they can be trapped using optical tweezers.
	\item The PDMS in the channel is now smooth enough to not be noticed with the microscope.
	\item Manual tracking is still necessary when tracking with the optical tweezers.
	\item Bubbles are still an issue, but are reduced as one gets more experienced in setting up the experiment.
\end{enumerate}
