In conclusion most of the problems addressed in the list in section \ref{list:problems} have been tackled. 

\begin{enumerate} \label{list:solutions}
	\item The particles are now all relatively symmetric with low aspect ratios and uniform widths and since they are glass they can be trapped using an optical tweezer.
	\item The PDMS in the channel is now smooth enough to not be noticed with the microscope.
	\item Manual tracking is still necessary when tracking with the optical tweezers.
	\item Bubbled are still an issue
\end{enumerate}
