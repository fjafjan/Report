In order to better understand the results and discussions in this thesis basic knowledge of fluid mechanics and image analysis is needed. This is given in this chapter along with a more detailed discussion of Jeffery orbits in particular. 

Since the main focus of this thesis is experimental, the theory background is only briefly summarized. A more inquisitive reader is recommended to read Einarssons licentiate thesis~\cite{JonasLic} which goes into greater detail concerning most of the topics covered in this chapter.
