In order to better understand the results and discussions in this thesis some rather basic knowledge in fluid dynamics, image analysis and other fields is needed. 

The focus of this thesis is experimental, so this chapter will not be entirely thorough. A more inquisitive reader is recommended to read Einarssons thesis~\cite{JonasThesis} which goes into greater detail on most of the topics covered in this section.
