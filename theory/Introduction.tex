In order to better understand the results and discussions in this thesis basic knowledge of fluid dynamics, image analysis and other fields is needed which will be given in this chapter. 

Since the main focus of this thesis is experimental, this chapter will not be entirely thorough. A more inquisitive reader is recommended to read Einarssons licentiate~\cite{JonasLic} which goes into greater detail on most of the topics covered in this section.
