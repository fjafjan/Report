\label{sec:jeffery}
The Jeffery orbits describe the orientational motion of an ellipsoidal particle in Stokes flow. The general equations of motion for any ellipsoid in shear flow were found by Jeffery\cite{Jeffery} who also solved these equations of motion for axisymmetric ($a_1 \ne a_2 = a_3$) ellipsoidal particles. Solutions for asymmetric particles were found numerically by Yarin \emph{et al.}~\cite{Yarin} who also rewrote the equations in a different but equivalent form. The equations of rotational motion for a triaxial particle in shear flow are in the form of Yarin \emph{et al.}

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:jeffrey}
\begin{align}
\frac{d\theta}{dt} 	&= (g_2 \sin \psi + g_3 \cos \psi ) \sin \theta, \\
\frac{d\phi}{dt} 	&= \tfrac{1}{2} + g_3\sin \psi - g_2 \cos \psi,\\
\frac{d\psi}{dt}	&= g_1 + (g_2\cos \psi - g_3\sin \psi) \cos \theta. \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent The functions  $g_i$ are defined as

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
g_1 &= \frac{a_2^2 - a_3^2}{2(a_2^2 + a_3^2)} 
		\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}(\cos^2 \theta + 1 )\sin 2\phi \sin 2\psi + \cos\theta \cos 2\phi \cos 2\psi \right), \\
g_2 &= \frac{a_3^2 - a_1^2}{2(a_1^2 + a_3^2)}
		\left( -\cos\theta \sin 2\phi \sin\psi  +  \cos 2\phi \cos\psi \right), \\
g_3 &= \frac{a_1^2 - a_2^2}{2(a_1^2 + a_2^2)}
		\left( \cos\theta \sin 2\phi \cos\psi + \cos 2\phi \sin\psi \right).
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Here $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$ are the Euler angles seen in Figure \ref{fig:eulerangles}. 
%Note that Yarin uses $a_x, a_y, a_z$ in place of $a_1, a_2, a_3$.

Note that the eq. (\ref{eq:jeffrey}) uses the coordinate system from Yarin \emph{et al.}\cite{Yarin} which differ from the one used in this thesis, details are discussed in Johansson \cite{AntonThesis}. Numerical solutions for three different initial conditions for an asymmetric particle are shown in Figure \ref{fig:orbitparams}.

The three orbits highlight the three different kinds of motion, the quasi-periodic sign changing orbit in blue, the quasi-periodic sign preserving orbit in red and the periodic orbit in green. We see that while $n_x$ and $n_y$ look qualitatively similar but differ in amplitude for the different orbits, $n_z$ shows three different types of behaviour}
\label{fig:orbittypes}
\end{figure}



Looking at Figure \ref{fig:orbitparams} we see that $n_x$ and $n_y$ are periodic, corresponding to periodic rotation around the $z$-axis. We refer to these rotations as flips. The period $\eta$ of $n_x$ and $n_y$ is for an axisymmetric particle \cite{Jeffery}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:flipRate}
\eta = 2\pi \left( \lambda + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)\frac{1}{\kappa},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\kappa$ is the shear rate. 

The time evolution of $\theta$ and $\psi$ for different initial conditions can be plotted in a Poincaré map, also known as a Surface-of-Section (S.O.S.)~\cite{poincare}. This plots the $\psi$ and $\theta$ coordinates each time $\phi = 0$. The successive points on the Poincaré map for each initial condition will move and explore certain regions of the surface of section. This region is referred to as the \emph{orbit}. 

For a particle with an asymmetry $\epsilon$ in the range $\left[0.01-0.05\right]$ there are three classes of orbits, depending on the initial condition $\theta_0$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Periodic}: $\left|\theta_0\right| \approx 1$ in which there is little variation and the particle is largely periodic with fluctuations too small to measure.
\item \textbf{Quasi-periodic sign preserving}: For $\left|\theta_0\right|> \theta_b$ the amplitude of $\cos(\theta)$ changes noticeably but does not change sign. Here $\theta_b$ is a breaking point that changes for different $\epsilon$.
\item \textbf{Quasi-periodic sign changing}: For small $\left|\theta_0\right| < \theta_b$ the amplitude of $\cos(\theta)$ changes noticeably and changes sign. 
\end{enumerate}

Simulations of these three different types of orbits for a particle with $\lambda=7$ and $\epsilon=0.05$ are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:orbittypes}. Figure \ref{fig:orbittypes} shows the orbits on the S.O.S. and Figure \ref{fig:orbitparams} show the components of $\mathbf{n}$ as a function of time. We can see that while $n_x$ and $n_y$ are periodic, albeit with different amplitudes, the  behaviour of $n_z$ is significantly different. The $n_z \approx 1$  orbit shown in green it is constant on the S.O.S and is simply periodic over time. For the sign presercing quasi-periodic orbit in red it is bent on the S.O.S and we can see in the time series that it is doubly periodic as it peaks with a fixed period but the amplitude of the peaks vary periodically themselves. For the sign changing quasi-periodic orbit in blue $n_z$ changes sign, again with a fixed period.


For larger asymmetries $\epsilon > 0.05$ there are chaotic orbits that explore a larger region of the S.O.S. The simulations used do not have long enough time evolutions for the chaotic orbits to fill the regions in the way that quasi-periodic or periodic orbits fill their two dimensional regions, the chaotic orbits appear as a 'sea' of dots. Chaotic orbits can been seen around the quasi-periodic sign changing orbits in figure \ref{fig:orbitmap4}.

\subsection{Winding number} \label{sec:winding}
The quasi-periodic orbits are also referred to as doubly-periodic~\cite{Yarin}. It is called doubly-periodic to emphasize the fact that the amplitude of the short period $\theta_2$ also varies periodically with period $\theta_1$. The ratio between the two periods is referred to as the winding number $\omega$ referring to the winding around a unit torus. The shorter period $\theta_2$ corresponds to rotations around the small cross section and the longer period $\theta_1$ corresponds to rotations around the large circumference of the torus. The winding number is defined as \cite{introchaos}

\begin{equation}
\omega_{def}  = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f^n(\xi) - \xi_0}{n}.
\end{equation}

where $\xi$ is the angle around the large circumference of the torus and $f^n(\xi)$ is the shift caused in $n$ rotations around the smaller axis. 
Applying this to our double-periodic the winding number would be the angle increment every flip in the function $g$ that is periodic with period 
$\theta_1$. We can not measure that increment, so I consider it more comprehensible to consider the inverse: The number of flips it is necessary to 
complete one period. This can be measured as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:windingDef}. If we measure over several $\theta_1$ peaks the average winding 
number will approximate the real one. 


$n$ as the number of flips of the particle which is $\frac{t}{\theta_1}$. $f^n(\xi) - \xi_0$ will converge to $\frac{n}{\theta_1}$ as the
 $\frac{\xi_0}{n}$ term decreases. Inverting it so that $\omega >= 1$ we get

\begin{equation}
\frac{t}{\theta_1}	
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:winding}
\omega = \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}.
\end{equation}
%
\noindent The winding number of the quasi-periodic sign preserving orbit from figure \ref{fig:orbittypes} is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:windingDef}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/theory/WindingNrFixed2.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The quasi-periodic sign preserving orbit from figure \ref{fig:orbitparams} over a longer time, highlighting the short period $\theta_2$ which is simply the period of $\phi$ and the longer period $\theta_1$. The winding number is defined as the ratio between the longer and shorter periods.}
\label{fig:windingDef}
\end{figure}

%This can also be thought of as the number of intersections on the surface of section before coming back to the initial condition, divided by the number of laps. A lap for a circular orbit is a rotation around the center whereas for a flat orbit it is moving along length of the orbit. asdasd, see figure MAKE A FIGURE. 
This number is the same for any point along a given orbit on a poincare map but changes for different orbits as well as for different asymmetries. The winding numbers for orbits along $\psi=0$ for $\epsilon=\{0.01, 0.05, 0.10\}$ can be seen in figure \ref{fig:windingdifferent}. This shows us that if we can measure the winding number it allows us to approximate the asymmetry of the particle.  This is done by looking at the difference in winding number between a quasi-periodic sign preserving orbit and a sign changing orbit. This is useful in order to differentiate between particles of different asymmetry, because they can have similar orbits but very distinct winding number.

\caption{The winding number as a function of $\cos(\theta)$ for three different asymmetries. The sharp edge that occurs centered around zero is where the sign changing orbits end and sign preserving orbits begin. We see that a lower asymmetry leads to a sharper difference between the sign changing and the sign preserving orbits.}
