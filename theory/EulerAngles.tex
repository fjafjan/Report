When describing rotating particles it is common to use the so-called Euler angles $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$. A formal definition is given by Diebel \cite{Euler} but for the purposes of this thesis we describe them as a transformation. We start with a stationary right-hand coordinate system $\{x,y,z\}$ with the $x$-axis along the length of the channel, the $z$-axis along the width of the channel, and the $y$-axis along depth. We define the Euler angles as the transformation from the channel coordinate system to the coordinate system attached to our particle $\{x',y',z'\}$. This transformation is performed in three steps by using an intermediate axis T.

\begin{itemize}
\item Rotate the $x$-$y$ plane $\phi$ radians about the $z$-axis. 
\item Denote the shifted $x$-axis $T$ and rotate the $z$-$y'$ plane $\theta$ radians around the $T$-axis
\item Denote the shifted $z$-axis $z$' and rotate the $x'$-$y'$ plane $\psi$ radians around the $z$' axis.
\end{itemize}

This procedure is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:eulerangles} where each prime marks one additional step of rotation to the coordinate system. Figure \ref{fig:eulerparticle} shows the Euler angles for a triaxial particle from a point of view similar to that of the experiment where the $x$-$z$ plane is the field of view. Note that although $\psi$ has an impact on the particle dynamics, we cannot observe it in our experiment as the particles are too symmetric around that axis, as is shown in section \ref{sec:particle_improves}

The conversion from $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$ to the unit vector $\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is given by 

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:nzEq}
\begin{align}
n_x 	&= \sin(\theta)\cos(\psi), \\
n_y 	&= \sin(\theta)\sin(\psi),\\
n_z		&= \cos(\theta).
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent In particular $n_z$ and $\cos(\theta)$ are be used interchangeably.

\subsection{Triaxial particles}
A triaxial particle is an ellipsoidal particle that has a distinct radius around the $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis. In other words it has distinct length, width and height. We refer to these lengths as $a_1, a_2, a_3$ with $a_1 > a_2 > a_3$.

%Triaxial particles have, as the name suggests, three axes which have distinct lengths. I will in this thesis refer to the lengths of these axes as  corresponding to their lengths along the $(x,y,z)$ axes when the rotation vector $\mathbf{E} = (0,0,0)$. 

When discussing triaxial particles that are close to being axisymmetric of the form $a_1 \gg a_2 \approx a_3$, it is convenient to introduce the particle asymmetry $\epsilon$ defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:epsilon}
\epsilon = \frac{a_2}{a_3} - 1,
\end{equation}

\noindent and the aspect ratio $\lambda$ given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lambda}
\lambda = \frac{a_1}{a_2}.
\end{equation}

These parameters are as used by among others Yarin \emph{et al.}~\cite{Yarin}.
% Where are we talking about this elsehwere?
%When trying to estimate the orientation of the particle from a projection in the x-z plane we will also be interested in the normalized projection of the particle onto the x-z plane. This will be referred to as $\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$

%We are interested in the orientation of the particle

%\begin{equation}
%n(t) = (n_x(t), n_y(t), n_z(t))^\intercal.
%\end{equation}
