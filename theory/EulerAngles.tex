When describing rotating p	articles it is common to use the so called Euler angles. A formal definition is given by Diebel \cite{Euler} but for the purposes of this thesis we will describe it as a transformation from our stationary coordinate system $\{x,y,z\}$ to the coordinate system attached to our particle $\{x',y',z'\}$. This transformation is performed in three steps by using the intermediate axis T.

\begin{itemize}
\item Rotate the x-y plane $\phi$ about the z-axis.
\item Denote the shifted x axis T and rotate the z-y' plane $\theta$ around this axis
\item Rotate $\psi$ around the z' axis to obtain the final coordinate system
\end{itemize}

This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:eulerangles} where each prim marks one additional step of rotation to the coordinate system. Figure \ref{fig:eulerparticle} shows the Euler angle rotations for a triaxial particle shown from a point of view similar to the of the experiment where the X-Z plane is the primary plane. This means we can describe the orientation of a particle using $\mathbf{E} = (\phi, \theta, \psi)$. Note that although $\psi$ has an impact on the particle dynamics, we cannot observe it in our experiment as the particles are too symmetric around that axis, as is shown in section \ref{sec:particle_improves}

The conversion from $\mathbf{E} = (\phi, \theta, \psi)$ to the unit vector $\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is given by 

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:nzEq}
\begin{align}
n_x 	&= \sin(\theta)\cos(\psi), \\
n_y 	&= \sin(\theta)\sin(\psi),\\
n_z		&= \cos(\theta)\\\
\end{align}

\subsection{Triaxial particles}
Triaxial particles have, as the name suggests, three axes which are all distinct, compared to a sphere which has only one distinct axis and spheroid that has two. I will in this thesis refer to the lengths of these axes as $a_x, a_y, a_z$ corresponding to their lengths along the $(x,y,z)$ axes when the rotation vector $\mathbf{E} = (0,0,0)$. 

It is, when discussing triaxial particles that are close to being axisymmetric or ellipsoids of the form $a_x \gg a_y \approx a_z$, convenient to introduce the particle asymmetry $\epsilon$ defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:epsilon}
\epsilon = \frac{a_y}{a_z} - 1,
\end{equation}

and the aspect ratio $\lambda$ given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lambda}
\lambda = \frac{a_x}{a_y}.
\end{equation}

% Where are we talking about this elsehwere?
%When trying to estimate the orientation of the particle from a projection in the x-z plane we will also be interested in the normalized projection of the particle onto the x-z plane. This will be referred to as $\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$

%We are interested in the orientation of the particle

%\begin{equation}
%n(t) = (n_x(t), n_y(t), n_z(t))^\intercal.
%\end{equation}
