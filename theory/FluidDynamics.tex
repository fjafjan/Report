In order to understand the motivations, limitations and behaviour of the experiment we need to know about a few key concepts in fluid dynamics.

\subsection{Reynold's Number}
The Reynolds number ($\operatorname{Re}$) is a dimensionless number describing the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a flow. For flow in a pipe it is defined by Pedley~\cite{introfluid} as


\begin{equation}\label{eq:reynolds}
\operatorname{Re} = \frac{U L \rho}{\mu}
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the characteristic velocity of the flow, $L$ is the characteristic length, $\rho$ is the density and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. This is used to estimate the 'regime' of the flow, of which there are two primary types. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Laminar flow, where viscous forces dominate over inertial forces
\item Turbulent regime where inertial forces dominate.
\end{enumerate}

The Reynolds number is a ratio between the inertial forces and viscous forces, so we get more turbulent flow for larger 
Reynolds numbers. A simple visual characterization of the flow types can be seen in figure \ref{fig:laminar_flow}. 
 $\operatorname{Re}\ll 1$ is referred to as \emph{Stokes flow} where we can ignore inertial forces completely. This 
 means that not only is the flow completely guaranteed to be laminar, but it is time reversible.
Reversing the direction of a Stokes flow and any dynamics of the flow and particles in the flow will revert perfectly as well~\cite{introfluid3}.

\subsection{Stokes Drag and Stokes's law}
The drag force $F_D$ exerted by a fluid on a spherical particle for $\operatorname{Re} \ll 1$ is found using the so called Stokes's law \cite{introfluid2}

\begin{equation}
F_D = 6\pi \mu R v,
\end{equation}

where $v$ is the velocity of the sphere relative to the fluid, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $R$ is the radius of the sphere. The terminal velocity of a sphere sinking in a liquid is found by equating the gravitational force $F_G$ acting on the sphere with the drag force. $F_G$ is

\begin{equation}
F_G = \Delta \rho g\cdot \frac{4\pi R^3}{3},
\end{equation}

where $\Delta \rho$ is the difference in density and $g$ is the specific gravity. We find that the terminal velocity of a sinking (or floating) sphere is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fallingSphere}
v_s = \frac{2}{9} \frac{\Delta \rho}{\mu} g R^2.
\end{equation}

This is referred to as Stoke's Law. % add citation?

%The p\'{}clet number describes the ratio of thermal noise to other stuff. I really don't know anything about the piclet number.
