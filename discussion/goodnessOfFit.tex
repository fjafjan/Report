 The method for matching the data to a theoretical orbit described in Section \ref{sec:matchorbit} finds the best fit but it is important to know how good of a fit it is. A flat fitness curve would mean a small change in the data leads to a large change in our matched orbit, i.e we have high uncertainty. To determine the goodness of fit we vary the three fitting parameters $\epsilon, \theta$, and $i$ separately and find the best fit for the other two parameters. In Figure \ref{fig:asymVariation} we find the best matching orbits for Particle A for asymmetries ranging from 0 to 0.2. The plot shows the difference $\left|n_z - \right|$ between the theoretical $n_z$ for the best matching orbits for that particular $\epsilon$ and the measured $n_z$ peaks for measurement 1 and 2. We see that there is a clear minima around $\epsilon = 0.02$ implying that it is a good fit.
 
 In Figure \ref{fig:orbitVariation} the match of stretch 1 from measurement 1 of particle A is matched to different orbits. We use the best matching asymmetry, match for orbits from the center of the pointcare map to the top. For each orbit we find the best starting position (the initial $\psi$). The result is a steady slope down to the correct orbit suggesting that this variable also had a clear best value that was chosen. 
 
 In Figure \ref{fig:initVariation} we use the best matching asymmetry and orbit for stretch 1 from measurement 1 of particle A, and the starting position (initial $\psi$) is varied over 1 full period. The relatively flat slope suggests that this parameter is not as clearly determined by this fit as the other two parameters.

The best orbit and best asymmetry are chosen, but different initial conditions are tested. Little variation is shown over different values suggesting that the value found is not strongly matched.}
