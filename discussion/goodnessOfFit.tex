 The method for matching the data to a theoretical orbit described in \ref{sec:matchorbit} finds the best fit but it is important to know how good of a fit. A flat fitness curve would mean a very small change in the data could lead to a very large change in our matched orbit. To determine the goodness of fit we vary the three parameters separately and find the best fit for the other two parameters. In Figure \ref{fig:asymVariation} we find the best matching orbits for Particle A for asymmetries ranging from 0 to 0.2. We see that there is a clear minima around $\epsilon = 0.02$ implying that it is a good fit.
 
 In Figure \ref{fig:orbitVariation} the match of stretch 1 from measurement 1 of particle A is matched. We use the best matching asymmetry, match for orbits from the center of the pointcare map to the top. For each orbit we find the best starting position (the initial $\psi$). The result is a steady slope down to the correct orbit suggesting that this variable also had a clear best value that was chosen. 
 
 The best In Figure \ref{fig:initVariation} we use the best matching 		asymmetry and orbit for stretch 1 from measurement 1 of particle A, and the starting position (initial $\psi$) is varied over 1 full period. The relatively flat slope suggests that this parameter while certainly improving the fit slightly is not as important as the other two parameters.
