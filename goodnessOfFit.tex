 To see how good of a fit these parameters actually are we can look at the goodness of fit fo the asymetry in figure \ref{fig:asymVariation}, the matched orbit for stretch 1 of measurement 1 figure \ref{fig:orbitVariation} and the starting position (initial $\psi$) for that orbit in figure \ref{fig:initVariation}.
